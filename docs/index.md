# Neuron ASync API generator

Neuron ASync API generator is a github action for generating `Neuron CRD's` or `documentation` out of [AsyncAPI documents](https://www.asyncapi.com/). It enforces a `document first` approach and with that keeps documenatation and Neuron topology and functions boilerplate code in sync.
It is mainly used together with the `Neuron Operator`.
